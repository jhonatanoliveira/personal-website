# About

A third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science researching probabilistic graphical models and generative deep learning models. Several academic publications including a recent paper at the top tier conference [AAAI 2019](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/). Research projects involving theoretical development and implementation of machine learning models, including Sum-Product networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), Bayesian networks, and Markov networks. Bachelor in Electrical Engineering with experience in robotics, parallel and numerical programming, and general artificial intelligence algorithms.

Extensive programming experience with Python, C++, and Java, and some experience with Matlab and OCaml. Professional web development experience in JavaScript (Node.js, Angular, Meteor.js), PHP (CakePHP, Zend), Python (Django, Flask), and Java (Struts2), including mobile development with Cordova and NativeScript / React Native.
